# DEFCON_Level_Alert_System

A Nuke alarm.

Pulls down DEFCON levels and military news from https://www.defconlevel.com/ and stores the data locally in case offline.

Also pulls down data from NASA pertaining to annual mean global temperature and climate change.

(This system uses my template which is heavy duty and me a lot of time).
