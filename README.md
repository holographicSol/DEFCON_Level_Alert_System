# DEFCON_Level_Alert_System

A Nuke alarm.

Pulls down DEFCON levels and military news from https://www.defconlevel.com/ and stores the data locally in case offline.

Also pulls down data from NASA pertaining to annual mean global temperature and climate change.

(This system uses my template which is heavy duty and took me a lot of time to create).

Testing DEFCON 1 can be achieved by editing any DEFCON level in defcon_level.txt while disconnected
from internet.
