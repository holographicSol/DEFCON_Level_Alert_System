
d1 = "[DEFCON 1]\n" \
     "Also called Cocked Pistol or white alert. DEFCON 1 is a white colored alert status and is a maximum " \
     "readiness condition level that was initially created in 1959 by the joint chiefs of staff.\nCocked Pistol means " \
     "that the United States is currently in a state of war, or that a nuclear threat is either in progress or " \
     "imminent.\nCocked Pistol, or DEFCON 1 may be reached if United States intelligence detects an imminent or " \
     "certain threat of either war or a nuclear launch from enemy forces.\nThe alert level color for Cocked Pistol is " \
     "white. Neither the department of defense, nor the United States Armed Forces have ever raised the status " \
     "condition to DEFCON 1 since the condition level was implemented."

d2 = "[DEFCON 2]\n" \
     "Also called Fast Pace, is a red colored condition level similar to a 'red alert' warning level status. DEFCON " \
     "2 means we are at the next step to war or a nuclear threat. During this alert level the United States Armed " \
     "Forces are ready and prepared to ship out in 6 hours time or less, hence the name 'Fast Pace'.\n" \
     "DEFCON 2, or Fast Pace is the second highest condition level in the warning system, with only alert level 1 " \
     "being higher. The alert status may be changed to this level after intelligence findings indicate a risk for an " \
     "impending attack, such as the case in the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 when the alert status was changed to " \
     "Fast Pace for the Strategic Air Command.\nDEFCON 2, or Fast Pace has been reached only once for the SAC, or " \
     "strategic air command during the cold war Cuban missile crisis in October 26, 1962 after soviet missile pads " \
     "were found in Cuba, but changed to alert level 3 after a short time."

d3 = "[DEFCON 3]\n" \
     "Also called Round House, is an increase in alertness and military readiness, also known as 'yellow alert' " \
     "status. With DEFCON 3 the air force is in a higher state or level of readiness so that they can deploy and " \
     "mobilize within 15 minutes time.\nThe alert color for DEFCON 3, or Round House is yellow. The meaning behind " \
     "this condition level is similar to that of a yellow 'caution' sign. We are prepared, cautious and in a state of " \
     "military readiness. This condition represents a state of preparedness and a high level of caution.\n" \
     "The alert status may be raised to DEFCON 3, or Round House after a precision strike is carried out by an an " \
     "enemy. This condition may also be reached after a precision strike is carried out by the United States " \
     "military or any event that warrants a cautious state of military readiness and alert by U.S forces."

d4 = "[DEFCON 4]\n" \
     "Also called Double Take, is an increase in intel gathering and strengthening of security protocols " \
     "and is also called the 'green alert' status. This condition status is considered 'Above Normal Readiness'.\n" \
     "The status alert color for DEFCON 4, or Double Take is green. This condition is just one level lower than " \
     "normal readiness and the military is on a lower state of readiness status during Double Take than the " \
     "previous alerts. The only alert status safer than this condition status is level 5, or Fade Out.\n" \
     "The United States alert status might be set to DEFCON 4, or Double Take after a precision strike on an " \
     "enemy target, or after a precision strike has been carried out by an enemy." \
     "Double Take, or DEFCON 4 may also be reached during a time of uncertainty while intelligence is gathered to " \
     "indicate the severity of a situation, or any situation where above normal readiness is required."

d5 = "[DEFCON 5]\n" \
     "Also called Fade Out, is the lowest or normal state of readiness and is also called 'blue alert' status. " \
     "DEFCON 5 means we are at a complete and total state of peace and have no immediate need to be on a high state " \
     "of alert.\nThe alert color for DEFCON 5 is blue and is also called 'normal readiness'. Some mistakenly believe " \
     "that condition level 5, or Fade Out is the highest state of readiness and that level 1 is the lowest. This " \
     "has been driven into popularity as a result of movies depicting DEFCON 5, or Fade Out as high alert level and " \
     "condition 1 as normal or peaceful alert status.\n" \
     "In reality DEFCON 5, or Fade Out is the lowest level that can possibly be reached and DEFCON 1 is in fact the " \
     "highest alert condition that can possibly be reached, and the highest state of military readiness.\n" \
     "DEFCON 5, or Fade out, being the lowest level of military readiness might mean a total and complete relaxed " \
     "state such as during peacetime, or the condition could mean that intelligence and forces are on a normal state " \
     "of alert and normal readiness."
